 *
 * For `/**` wildcard targets, the resolver forwards `event.url.pathname`
 * exactly as h3 served it (an encoded `%2f` stays opaque — like nginx
 * `proxy_pass $request_uri`), and the scope check canonicalizes to reject
 * traversal that only surfaces once a downstream decodes that separator.
 *
 * For non-wildcard targets, the raw request query string is forwarded with
 * full fidelity (no URLSearchParams round-trip, which would collapse
 * duplicate keys and re-encode values); the target's own query params come
 * first, the request's are appended after.
